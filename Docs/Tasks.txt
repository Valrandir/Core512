Asteroid use the magic number 16 from CoreZone
Address GridMap Addressing

Tasks
- Consider creating an INT CoreVector to avoid casting to (int) all the time in CoreZone GridMap
- Seperate the GridMap section from CoreZone and put it in its own class, possibly inside of CoreZone.
- Improve CoreConfig
  - Make it like Config.Core512.UseMusic instead of Config.UseMusic
    and Config.Resolution.Width instead of Config.Width
- Turn Animation
- FullScreen / Windowed
- Important (System) keypress should be captured at in the wndfunc messages as well to respond better in heavy cpu usage situations

Code Improvement
- Create CoreAnimation
- Add Comment headers to each code file (Purpose, Author, see what is used thought open source projects)
- Consider using forward class declaration (class CoreVector;) in Header files instead of adding the #include for it

Next Feature
DONE - Expand the world past the visible window rectangle
DONE - Scroll only when the ship is about to move outside of a center rectangle sized at 50% of screen size.
- Add a zoom function.
- Give some HitPoints to the ship and display them on screen as a % value
- Make the ship explode when HP are <= 0, reset the ship after the explosion animation.
DONE - Add two border zones to the world.
- When the ship is in the first border zone it loses HP over time.
- When the ship is in the second border zone, set HP to zero.
DONE - In the lose hp zone, Alpha degrade background color/texture to black
DONE   Up to the middle of the zone, then to while up to the start of the
DONE   explode zone.

- Next add 3 asteroids which are made of 16x16 blocks

*-------------------------*

- Make the ship rebound a little and take a % damage when it touch them, or something
- Make the ship shoot kind of hybrid plasma
- Shooting the asteroids make some blocks disappears.

This could mean making a explosion list manager, and a dynbody list manager to handle all the projectiles.
Also need to move the directional vector out of the ship class and into dynbody

Ideas
- Radar to display some minimap
- Different kind of radars and minimaps for different tasks.
- Each radar is specialized but can still be configured
- DF like survival and base building using
	- Day/Night cycle as the sun is hidden by a planet or moon
	- Build a base to hide from the sun during the "day"
	- Most active at "night"
	- Once the base is built enough, add solar panels to harvest sun energy
	- Upgrades to allow operations when the sun is not hidden
