- Pass class/struct using const reference
- Ensure const correctness
- Use public const references as public read-only properties
    Non const references at the end of the chain are still not const even if the parent accessor is.
- Call inherited stuff using full path: CoreBody::CoreRect::Center
- Use ErrExit.h Try/Trn/Stackit
