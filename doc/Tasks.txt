Tasks
- DONE - Create INI file
- DONE - Ship Direction Vertex
- DONE - Propulsion Particle Effect
- Turn Animation
- Half Done - Add error headers from a past project
- Consider automatically running HGE "PNG Optimizer" "pngopt.exe *.png"
  in Exec folder after a release build

Next Feature
- Expand the world past the visible window rectangle
- Scroll only when the ship is about to move outside of a center rectangle sized at 50% of screen size.
- Add a zoom function.
- Give some HitPoints to the ship and display them on screen as a % value
- Make the ship explode when HP are <= 0, reset the ship after the explosion animation.
- Add two border zones to the world.
- When the ship is in the first border zone it loses HP over time.
- When the ship is in the second border zone, set HP to zero.
- In the lose hp zone, Alpha degrade background color/texture to black
  Up to the middle of the zone, then to while up to the start of the
  explode zone.

*-------------------------*

- Make the ship rebound a little and take a % damage when it touch them, or something
- Make the ship shoot kind of hybrid plasma
- Shooting the asteroids make some blocks disappears.

This could mean making a explosion list manager, and a dynbody list manager to handle all the projectiles.
Also need to move the directional vector out of the ship class and into dynbody


Possible Code Improvement
- Consider passing structs as const reference instead of by value
- Apply const correctness
- Add Operators to Vertex
- Always use Vertex instead of x y
- Review Quad and Rect init and updates

Ideas
- Radar to display some minimap
- Different kind of radars and minimaps for different tasks.
- Each radar is specialized but can still be configured
- DF like survival and base building using
	- Day/Night cycle as the sun is hidden by a planet or moon
	- Build a base to hide from the sun during the "day"
	- Most active at "night"
	- Once the base is built enough, add solar panels to harvest sun energy
	- Upgrades to allow operations when the sun is not hidden
